Solana Token Launcher

A powerful and easy-to-use Web3 token launcher built with React, designed for the Solana blockchain.
Easily create and deploy SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens in just a few clicks!

Features
	•	Create custom SPL tokens on Solana
	•	Connect Phantom or any Solana-compatible wallet
	•	Set token name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply
	•	Deploy tokens instantly to Solana devnet or mainnet
	•	Clean and responsive UI built with React

Tech Stack
	•	React.js
	•	Solana Web3.js (@solana/web3.js)
	•	HTML/CSS
	•	[Optional] TailwindCSS / Material-UI (if you used a styling framework)

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-token-launcher.git
cd solana-token-launcher

	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install

	3.	Start the development server:

npm start

Usage
	1.	Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
	2.	Choose the network (Devnet or Mainnet)
	3.	Enter token details:
	•	Token Name
	•	Token Symbol
	•	Decimals
	•	Initial Supply
	4.	Click “Create Token”
	5.	Approve the transaction in your wallet
	6.	Your new token will be live on Solana!

How It Works
	•	Uses Solana Web3.js to interact with the blockchain
	•	Mints tokens to the creator’s wallet address
	•	Optionally initializes a token metadata account (if Metaplex is integrated)

Basic example using Solana Web3.js to create a token:

import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { createMint } from "@solana/spl-token";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
const payer = Keypair.generate();

const mint = await createMint(
  connection,
  payer,       // Payer
  payer.publicKey,  // Mint Authority
  null,         // Freeze Authority
  9             // Decimals
);

Quick Note:

If you added extra features like:
	•	Token metadata (using Metaplex)
	•	Token listing on Solana explorers
	•	Airdrop functionality
	•	NFT mode toggle

… we can extend the README to include those too.

Would you also like me to create a short example for a Demo Section if you have a live URL? It really impresses people on GitHub.
Also, I can suggest some badges (like “Built with Solana”, “Made with React”, “License MIT”) if you want!
